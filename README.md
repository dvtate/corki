## History:
Corki bot originated out of necessity in the [CorkiMains Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/8ASxJG2), eventually improving upon the functionality of other bots in order to fit our needs and provide new features. Corki bot is now used in a number of other servers in addition to being the main discord bot CorkiMains.
